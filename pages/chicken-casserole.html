            <h2>Directions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Add chicken, beans, corn, cream of chicken soup, tomatoes and chiles (with juice), green chiles, cream cheese, and cilantro. Cook until cream cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Spread out 1/3 of the chips on the bottom of a 9x13 inch rectangular casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the chicken mixture.
